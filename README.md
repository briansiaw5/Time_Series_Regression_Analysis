## Introduction

This project aims to perform a time series regression analysis on training data, test data, stores data, oil price data and a few others The primary objective is to build a model that can accurately predict the unit sales for lots of items sold at different Favorita stores.

The analysis includes:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model selection and training
- Performance evaluation
- Visualization of results

## Dataset

The datasets used for this analysis  are all in .csv format and were obtained from 3 sources: a database, OneDrive and a GitHub repository. 
It includes train.csv, training data,test.csv
The datasets include:
- train.csv
- training data
- test.csv
- transaction.csv
- sample_submission.csv
- stores.csv
- oil.csv
- holidays_events.csv

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Feature scaling
- Time-based feature extraction

### 2. Model Selection
- [List the models used, e.g., Linear Regression, ARIMA, XGBoost]
- Justification for model choice

### 3. Model Training and Evaluation
- Training process
- Cross-validation
- Performance metrics used (e.g., RMSE, MAE)

### 4. Visualization
- Time series plots
- Predicted vs Actual values

## Results

The results of the analysis showed that [briefly summarize the key findings or model performance]. The best-performing model was [mention the best model] with a [mention key performance metric].
