## Introduction

This project aims to perform time series regression analysis on [describe the dataset or time series data]. The primary objective is to [mention the goal, such as predicting future values, understanding trends, etc.].

The analysis includes:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model selection and training
- Performance evaluation
- Visualization of results

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is [describe the dataset, including the source if applicable]. It includes [briefly describe the features and target variable, e.g., time-related features, numerical variables, etc.].

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Feature scaling
- Time-based feature extraction

### 2. Model Selection
- [List the models used, e.g., Linear Regression, ARIMA, XGBoost]
- Justification for model choice

### 3. Model Training and Evaluation
- Training process
- Cross-validation
- Performance metrics used (e.g., RMSE, MAE)

### 4. Visualization
- Time series plots
- Predicted vs Actual values

## Results

The results of the analysis showed that [briefly summarize the key findings or model performance]. The best-performing model was [mention the best model] with a [mention key performance metric].
